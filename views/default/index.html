<br />
Starting this (historic?) year, the FrEE Symposium will be a three-day summer event co-organized by a committee of Masters and  PhD students at the <a target="_blank" 
href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/silwood-park/">Silwood Park campus</a>  (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/life-sciences/">Department of Life Sciences</a> of Imperial College London. 

<br />
<br />

This is an exciting opportunity for students to present their research, see what colleagues are up to, and discuss challenges in Ecological and Evolutionary research with peers and seniors. 

The symposium will be broken into concurrent sessions of focal research themes, and morning and afternoon sessions will be kicked off with keynote lectures delivered by six invited speakers.
